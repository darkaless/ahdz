									<p>
										----Today is day seven. The seventh day is today. Today is a day…. Today. <br>
										It’s a terrible thing to be trapped in a room with yourself. Four walls, a bed and 10,080 seconds with your mind. Have I gone mad already? So much time. Sixteen steps to wide, eighteen steps long. White walls; white ceiling; white bed. One, two, three, four walls and me. 

									</p>
									<p>
										I don’t remember what I look like. It feels like I’ve been here forever. My skin has gone white pale… Like these walls. Like a ghost. No one sees me, no one hears me. Am I dead already? Perhaps I am, and I am being punished in this asylum for being born.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes I lose track of time. I can’t tell if its night or day. All I know is that 168 hours have passed since I opened my eyes and woke up in this room. It’s always grey in here. The light comes from the upper part of my door. It’s the only source of it and it is always on. Food is served two times a day. I have come to terms with it really. It is not that bad if you hold your breath while you chew. Not that it’s sustainable… My skin and bones are almost one now, since the voices didn’t let me eat the first three days. At least it keeps my stomach from making sounds and they calm down for a moment.
									</p>
									<p>
										I haven’t spoken a word in seven days. I haven’t head myself in that long. I don’t want to. I listen to the others screaming for help in the other rooms, but nothing ever happens. I’m sure I would be no different. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I cried for 18 hours on my first day. The voices were so loud and mean. They screamed at me calling me a murderer. After that day, my eyes ran dry and I haven’t cried since. Day two, I spent sitting on the right hand corner. I counted all the cracks in the wall that day, the voices said the little ones are shaped like veins, and in them runs the blood of all the other ill people who died here. When I was done I repeated the alphabet in my head for 180 times. I had to repeat the first two times because the voices were so loud and I couldn’t concentrate.  After that I made a mental note of all the books I had read and decided to make a small summary of every single one in my head. That took me till the half of day three because the voices always interrupt. That day I sat in the middle of the room, closed my eyes and counted my breaths to try and block the voices out.  After six hours of it my legs were numb and my back hurt. 
									</p>
									<p>
										As I laid down on the bed I closed my eyes and tried to imagine all the colors that existed. I fell asleep as I was doing that. When I opened my eyes, I noticed I was slightly cheerful and the voices were not scramming. Even though I was not tired anymore. I sat down on the floor and closed my eyes once again. This time I let my mind take me away and ignored the voices until they shut up. I imagined all the animals in technicolor and fell asleep once again until the next day. 
									</p>

		
									<p>
										In my dreams I found peace. I repeated this process until today, the seventh day. Yesterday, the voices told me to take a pen from one of the nurses. They want me to hurt myself with the pen. I don’t want to but they won’t calm down. They say only if I do it they will quiet down.  I don’t know how long I will be here. I can’t. I can’t think. I can’t breathe. I have to make them stop somehow. 
									</p>
									<p>
										They repeat over and over again, “When you dream you remember you were. To help you remember yourself and make you forget this horrible place you must take the deep sleep.”  
									</p>

									<p>
										I know what they want. And they’re right. I know they are but I’m so scared. <br>
										“We will do it for you, just let us guide you,” they said. <br>
										So I let them, I let them take me away. Drift my mind away from these four walls. They were right… 
										When I sleep I remember. <br>
										 I remember who I used to be and how happy I was. And through the deep sleep… <br>
										 I live. ----
									</p>
									<p> 
										Creative writing is something that has been with me since high school. I remember telling my classmates I would write a book someday. Anyway, in the meantime, I wanted to share with you an entry of one of my short stories. Julie is a schizophrenic who has been put on an asylum to be forgotten. She has lost her family, friends, life and even herself. The only way she has found comfort is in her dreams. After seven days of being entrapped with herself, she decides to give in to the voices she hears and take her life away. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the morbid read and my digital sketch. I spent all Sunday sketching the idea for you to see! If you guys have snapchat add me (katia_hdz). I always post my process of sketching, daily life and bts of photoshoots! Hope you have a wonderful day.
									</p>

									<p>Good vibes, Katia A. Hernandez</p>
