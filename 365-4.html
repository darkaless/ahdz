										Inner peace is a so underrated. To me, it is the most important factor in life. Nothing has worth if you don’t have inner peace… nothing has meaning if you’re inner self is not balanced. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Personally, this was a struggle for a long time. Most days, I was so unhappy with myself that I couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror… Other days I couldn’t handle all the chaos and background noise that I had in my head and I would rather sleep all day and zone out. But it’s a process. Some people call it growing up. But honestly, I don’t think it is something that just happens as you grow older. People live empty lives for years and years and are just dead inside because that have no inner peace. They seek escape in alcohol, drugs, food and all types of activities to keep themselves from feeling… to keep themselves from accepting that they are not okay.  
									</p>
									<p>
										And that really is the first step. Acceptance. <br>
										Acceptance of yourself and of your current situation. Acceptance of your failures, struggles, fears and challenges. It’s taking it all in and embracing it… Embracing who you really are. Because you are beautiful and strong. And you have the power to take back all the time you lost finding yourself and make it worthwhile. 

									</p>
									<p>
										Society fills our head with trash. They make us compare ourselves to unattainable and “picture perfect” goals. That trash makes you under-valuate yourself.  It makes you doubt your beauty and self-confidence. And is it really worth it to lose yourself to that?

									</p>
									<p>
										It is hard to embrace that negativity and change your mindset… But it is possible. You are capable of anything you set your mind to. The mind is a powerful thing. And every day you must remind yourself of all that is true. Of all that is good… This takes me back to that wonderful quote from The Help, “You is kind, you is smart, you is important.”  And it really is true. Accept that. Embrace it. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I remember one day in high school, my literature teacher showed us a video for our speech class. It was from TED talks and in the video the Dr. talked about how you could “Fake it till’ you make it.” I remember thinking at the time, “What a stupid thing to do, I bet it doesn’t work.” A year later, while I was in college, I was going through a hard emotional time, but I promised myself that I wouldn’t slide back into depression. And that quote came back to me, “Fake it till’ you make it” I did, fake it. Repeated to myself three good things in the morning while I looked at myself in the mirror. I said, “You are creative, you are strong, you are happy with yourself.” I said that over and over for days and eventually months. I put on my smile every day, I talked to other people, went to the gym and kept on going with my life. 
									</p>

									<p>
										I saw how I changed… Only by focusing on those three things and embracing all positive-ness around me. People who know me now, probably doubt that I was ever depressed. But it is still a very heavy part of my past. Sometimes I’m embarrassed of my scars, but all those challenges and dark times made me who I am today. I think those circumstances have shaped me and given me a guide to expand my creative horizons.  
									</p>
									<p>
										So, my advice to you, friend… If you are going through a hard time, you can get out of there. Look for people with the same interest as you. Build your own community of friends. Surround yourself of positive people who won’t bring you down but help you accept yourself and move on. If you wish to contact me, you can do so as well. I would be more than happy to speak with you and share with you a conversation.  
									</p>

									<p>Good vibes, Katia A. Hernandez</p>
