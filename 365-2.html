									<p>
										I’m sitting at a coffee shop, pondering of the good things that came off the day. It has been a productive day after all. Let me tell you how my day started. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Today, I had a very weird morning. I woke up, excited to take the picture of the day. I prepared myself mentally and got all my things ready. I was thinking of using a very beautiful fabric that I have and maybe create some shapes with it. As I was walking outside to my backyard, I noticed that the housekeeper was working in the back, so I was like, “well, I’ll just go to the other side where he can’t see me.” Anyway, I set the tripod in place, grabbed my little remote, the fabric and positioned myself in the center. 
									</p>
									<p>
										As I was taking some light shots, something stung my foot! I looked down and saw that I was standing in an infested area of big red ants (the ones that sting when they bite!) It was terrible! My whole leg got covered in ants… I ran away from that area and decided to venture in some unexplored area of the house… BAD IDEA! My beautiful fabric got caught in a tree and ripped. It seemed that the forces of the universe were really conspiring against me. And you know what they say about Karma: she’s a bitch
									</p>

									<p>
										I was left looking for a spot, with a half useful fabric and my camera. My initial idea was not working, so I decided to go with the moment and try different things. I thought about doing some levitation shots. And as I was doing that, I looked around and the housekeeper had made an event out of this. He was supposed to be gardening or something but I guess he saw all the mess I was doing and decided I was more interesting than gardening. Well, great, right? Now I had an audience…. Not. If you don’t know me, you probably think I’m just stuck up but I’m actually really introverted. It gets a while for you to get me talking comfortably with you. And even worse, taking a levitation shot in front of him? If you don’t know, that shot would require me jumping a million times awkwardly in front of my camera. As if I would do that in front of people! 
									</p>
									<p>
										Yikes… It really seemed like everything was going to hell. I had already been an hour outside and I had no progress on the picture. My initial excitement was wavering and I didn’t even feel like continuing with this. After a few minutes of sitting down in the grass contemplating what to do, I decided to go for a more regular concept. And it got me thinking, sometimes I focus so much on making something happen that I just get disappointed because I don’t meet my expectations. I guess that happens to a lot of people as well, especially us, self-critics. But today, I don’t want to let this disappoint me. I can’t let this affect my whole day in a negative manner. 
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										I took a few more shots of just my natural self and went back to the comfort of my house. As I look at this picture, I think, “Maybe it’s not the greatest picture or the most flattering. But it is me… Introverted and a little awkward sometimes, but with plenty of hunger to live.” 
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										That is what this picture says to me at this moment. I have 363 more days to go. This is only the beginning. And even though today I made an “okay” picture, I still want more. But then again, that is what makes me always strive for something better and that’s okay. That drive will keep me going.
									</p>

									<p>Sincerely, Katia A. Hernandez</p>
